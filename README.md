# Hash-Code-2022-Qualification-Round
So, it was a tough problem. As always it was an optimization problem.
I loved one thing about the winner team of Qualification-Round, and that is their name, # Make love, not war and interestingly it was from Russia, who have started a war with Ukraine Just today after a long time of small conflicts.It tried to show that even we don't want war, it may be the decision of some of Russians but not all of us here want it.
Coming to the solution, It was my first time competing in Hash Code but still I am happy that I understood the problem and come up with a solution and I got only 10809 points and ranked 4979.
I am sharing my code here and I might work on it in the future to improve it.
